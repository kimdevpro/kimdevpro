# Hi there, I'm Kimberly Reddick 👋

## About Me

💻 After over a decade of supporting applications and scripting on the backend, I am now taking my career to the next level by transitioning into full-time web development. This move reflects my long-standing passion for programming and my desire to build modern, user-centered applications from the ground up.

🌐 I am currently focused on front-end technologies and building responsive, accessible websites. My journey has also included exploration in game development using Unity and C#.
